🖼️ AI-Based Image Caption Generator using Generative AI
This project is a simple AI-powered web application that takes an image as input and generates a relevant caption using a pre-trained BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining) model. It's built using Hugging Face Transformers and Streamlit for demonstration.

📌 Project Overview
Objective:
